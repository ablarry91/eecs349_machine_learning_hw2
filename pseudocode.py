Tests for splits: 

For Discrete Attributes: 
Is A equal to blah

For Continuous Attributes:
threshold = the cases in Nm are sorted on their values (distinctAttributes)
gives ordered liste of distinct values v_i, ... v_n. 
For every pair of adjacent valuess suggest a potential threshold t = (vi + vi+1)/2
and choose threshold that yeild best value of the splitting criterion 
selected. 
Is A less than or equal to threshold


Splitting criterion: Gain ratio
